                        <p class="lead text-muted">The slightly caffeinated mind behind the madness, Matthew Bowen.</p>
                        <p>By day, Matthew Bowen is a middle-aged, bearded author who wrangles his own chaotic adventuring party of three young kids, all under the command of their raid leader: his amazing wife. He assures everyone that his beard, while impressive, is mostly for storing biscuit crumbs and does not, to his knowledge, contain any arcane spell components.

By night, fueled by an unhealthy amount of coffee, he trades his dad-duties for lich-duties, exploring the kinds of questionable life choices one makes when faced with eternity. His extensive experience in fantasy realms like Azeroth has taught him two things: 1) grinding for epic loot is remarkably similar to grinding out a novel, and 2) you should never, ever trust a wizard who says his new experiment is "perfectly safe."

He believes that even after transcending the petty squalor of mortal needs, you still need a friend to remind you where you left your notes, and a very, very patient spouse to remind you to take out the trash.</p>
